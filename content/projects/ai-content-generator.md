## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture
Built with **Next.js 13** utilizing the App Router for optimal performance and SEO. The interface is designed with **Radix UI** components and styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a clean, professional look.

```typescript
// Example: AI content generation hook
import { useState, useCallback } from 'react';
import { useToast } from '@/hooks/use-toast';

interface GenerationOptions {
  prompt: string;
  contentType: 'blog' | 'social' | 'email' | 'product';
  tone: 'professional' | 'casual' | 'friendly' | 'formal';
  length: 'short' | 'medium' | 'long';
  keywords?: string[];
}

export function useAIGeneration() {
  const [isGenerating, setIsGenerating] = useState(false);
  const [generatedContent, setGeneratedContent] = useState<string>('');
  const { toast } = useToast();

  const generateContent = useCallback(async (options: GenerationOptions) => {
    setIsGenerating(true);
    
    try {
      const response = await fetch('/api/generate', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify(options),
      });

      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error('Generation failed');
      }

      const { content } = await response.json();
      setGeneratedContent(content);
      
      toast({
        title: 'Content Generated!',
        description: 'Your AI-generated content is ready for review.',
      });
    } catch (error) {
      toast({
        title: 'Generation Error',
        description: 'Failed to generate content. Please try again.',
        variant: 'destructive',
      });
    } finally {
      setIsGenerating(false);
    }
  }, [toast]);

  return {
    generateContent,
    generatedContent,
    isGenerating,
    setGeneratedContent,
  };
}
```
